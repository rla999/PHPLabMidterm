# PHPLabMidterm
The midterm lab edition of my F/X calculator for my PHP web dev class. I use initialization (INI) files and a comma separated value (CSV) file to store important parameters and data for the web app. That way if I want to modify the currency codes and exchange rates, I just have to update the CSV file. Likewise, a simple update to the INI files is all that is needed to change the parameters.
